# Frequently Asked Questions

Here are some frequently asked questions about EPF program. You can also watch the [EPF5 Town Hall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrwKxyBIYYk) presentation, an intro to previous cohort, and keep an eye for upcoming cohort 6 town hall to ask questions before the cohort starts. 

- **Will I learn to develop applications on the Ethereum blockchain?**
    - No. This program is not focused on Solidity or other development of smart contracts. 
- **I'm not able to commit to "full time" (aka 40 hours a week). Can I still participate?**
    - Yes. There are no hard restrictions on how many hours you must put towards the program. The amount of time you will need to invest is going to depend on your current level of knowledge and what project you choose to pursue.  It will be difficult to be successful in the program if you are unable to commit at least 20 hours per week.
- **What projects can I work on?**
    - There are many projects [proposed by client teams](/projects/project-ideas.md) you can choose from. Fellows have full freedom in deciding what they want to work on and you can also propose your own project, as long as it's be related to the core protocol. 
- **I don't know much about ______________.  Can I still apply?**
    - Yes. Computer science/programming skills and general knowledge about Ethereum protocol are expected but it's normal to have gaps. Read through the [program details](./program-details.md) to get a sense for what type of prior knowledge you should be working towards to be successful in the program. To learn about the Ethereum core protocol, you can get started with [EPF Study Group materials](https://epf.wiki).
- **When does it start and what is the duration?**
    - Program will start in June 2025 and continue for 5 months, culminating with an in-person event at [Devconnect](https://devconnect.org/)  in November. 
- **What happens after the 5 months is complete?**
    - If you create valuable contributions during the cohort, it will be easier for you to continue working in the protocol areas. We do not guarantee any employment after the cohort is over but the experience will make it easier to search for one. This could be continued grant-style funding, a job with a team that's working on something interesting to you, or other teams related to the core protocol.
- **Where is the fellowship located?**
    - As all core Ethereum teams, EPF is distributed around the globe. We will do our best to accommodate call times for those selected for the program.
- **Who are the mentors and how can I interact with them?**
    - Mentors are developers and researchers from client teams. They are available mainly to provide feedback to your work, their mentorship is not meant as direct guidence or education. You can find details on how the mentorship works [here](./mentors.md).
- **Is funding available? Is it payable in ETH or Fiat?**
    - Some candidates will be selected for funding at the start of the program and we will work with individual applicants to determine a "stipend" amount which will allow you to focus your effort on this program. For fellows that are awarded the stipend, funding options for both crypto and fiat will be available. The funding is subject to KYC, we are not able to issue stipend to sanctioned individuals or in countries on sanctions lists (e.g. North Korea, Iran, etc). 
- **Will there be an interview process?**
    - Yes. After reviewing applications, select applicants will be scheduled for an interview. 
- **How many applicants will be accepted in this cohort?**
    - The exact number depends on number of applications, budget, and capacity of mentors.
- **Can I still participate even if I am not selected in this cohort?**
    - Yes. Being selected into the program is really just the group that we'll be working directly with to provide funding. The program is going to happen in the open, same like contributing to any Ethereum project, meaning that anyone who wants to participate can be a part of the program. 
- **Who is running the program?**
   - The program is funded by the Ethereum Foundation and run by the Protocol Support Team. It is important to note that the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.foundation/philosophy/) does not own, operate, or manage Ethereum but exists to support the protocol and the Ethereum community through funding and research. This is a public program to increase the knowledge about the core protocol and help all core free and open source clients and projects.
