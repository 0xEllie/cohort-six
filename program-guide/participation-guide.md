# How to Participate in EPF

EPF is a program for aspiring developers dedicated to work on Ethereum core protocol. The core of the cohort is a group of selected participants working full time, however, the whole program an open, public and permissionless. Anyone can participate by joining our regular calls, Discord channel and submitting regular updates. 

## Dive In

EPF starts by learning about the core protocol. Visit the [EPF Wiki](https://epf.wiki) and get started immersing yourself in the various Ethereum protocol topics. Contribute to the wiki to cover gaps in content you find interesting and add any materials you discover yourself.

If you have the necessary skills and feel confident enough with your Ethereum knowledge to start contributing, you can start by exploring [Good First Issues](https://gfi.bordel.wtf) across clients and other core projects.

## Choose a project

Based on your learning experience about the protocol, identify missing pieces and projects to contribute. Mentors have [suggested various projects](/projects/project-ideas.md) you can work on, take your time to dive into them, learn about their protocol area and context. You can propose your own project as well, make sure it's valuable to current core protocol efforts. 

During the first month, choose a project that you would like to build or contribute to on during the duration of the program and write your own project proposal with the specification. Your project does not need to be completed at the end of the program but you are expected to make significant progress during the five months of the program. Based on the project scope, consider teaming up with other fellows.

## Participate in the discussion

Join the Ethereum R&D Discord. Use the *#protocol-fellowship* channel for general discussion but use the appropriate channels for conversations regarding specific topics, especially if you are seeking assistance or feedback from a mentor. Please keep this discussion relevant to what you are working on. Our intention is to keep these channels open, but if there is a lot of noise, restrictions may be added. You can also use the [Study Group discord](https://discord.gg/hFrSEHyjYZ) to discuss learning materials and contributions to the wiki. 

>  We use Discord because that's where the core community is the most active but we are aware that it's proprietary and doesn't respect user privacy. Consider using alternative FOSS clients like [Dissent](https://github.com/diamondburned/dissent) or  [WebCord](https://github.com/SpacingBat3/WebCord). For enhancing the regular client, check [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/BetterDiscord/BetterDiscord/) project.

## Make weekly updates

Weekly updates help us, mentors and other contributors to see how you are progressing in your project. Making an update each week will not only keep you accountable to your project, but it will also track your ability to do the work. Additionally, weekly updates help you practice technical writing, explaining your ideas to others through written posts, which is one of the primary ways that information about Ethereum is spread. Remember that our goal is to help you find placement with a client team, research team, or help you to become a funded independent contributor.

*How to make weekly updates*
- Follow the guidelines in the [Repo Guide](./repo-guide.md)
- Post your update or a link to your update in the [Development Updates](/development-updates.md)
- Link your update in the weekly update thread in *#protocol-fellowship*

## Get help from Mentors

[Mentors](./mentors.md) from client teams who proposed projects are available to assist with the work project. Mentors are NOT here to teach you how to do things, tell you what to do or hold you accountable to your project. They can unlock roadblocks, give feedback on your progress, or help point you in the right direction if you are stuck.

>Please be respectful of mentorsâ€™ time. Try to figure it out on your own first. If asking for help is necessary, be concise and direct.

*How to interact with mentors*
- Do not approach mentors before doing your own research and at least basic work on the project
- First reach out to cohort organizers to ask about mentor's availability and share what you need
- We can connect your with a mentor directly or point you to the right place:
    - Ask in a public client teams chat, like their Discord server
    - You can ask a question in the #protocol-fellowship channel and tag them
    - Ask a specific question about the topic you are working on in the appropriate channel
- If an ongoing conversation is necessary, ask the mentor for a direct message contact. Consider setting up a regular call if they are available
- Add a comment in the [Office Hours](https://github.com/eth-protocol-fellows/cohort-five/issues) issue in the GitHub repo for the upcoming meeting outlining the problem you are having or the discussion you would like to happen

## Join weekly meetings

There will be 2 meetings every week. One will be a weekly stand-up meeting, where you can discuss your progress with other participants. The second is the Office Hours meeting, where mentors will be present to discuss the topics that have been raised in the GitHub issue for that week. Both of these meetings are open to all participants.
