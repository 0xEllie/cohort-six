# Proposed projects

Project ideas proposed by client teams and mentors. These are projects that fit the EPF scsope and would be the most valuable to the team. 

If you are interested in the project, take your time to learn about it, the team it's coming from and related area of the protocol. Reach out to client organizers if you have any questions or need connection to a mentor.

### Lodestar: Backfill

By Lodestar

Lodestar's TypeScript-based Ethereum consensus client currently does not have a backfill mechanism to retain blocks/blobs required, conduct backfill syncing and eventually serve custody column groups when moving towards PeerDAS. This feature will expose a candidate to various parts of the Ethereum consensus protocol, including new chain features whilst producing a high priority need for the implementation. For more information, please check: https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/issues/7753

### Lodestar: ERA file support

By Lodestar

Lodestar's TypeScript-based Ethereum consensus client is seeking a fellow interested in helping to produce and use Era files for historical state regeneration as an alternative to backfill syncing and minimizing unnecessary data stored on nodes. For more information, please check: https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/issues/7048
